/*
 * Description    : Tests that a proper error messags is returned for this scenario.
 *                  Since we cannot statically know the type of the field 'title', the FuzzyEqRule
 *                  cannot auto-inject a tokenizer, and hence we expect an error saying that we cannot
 *                  scan over a string as if it were a collection.
 *                  Guards against regression to issue 207.
 * Success        : Yes
