     * in ASTERIX storage. The dataset is populated either using a load
     * statement or using insert statement. EXTERNAL: A dataset with data
     * residing outside ASTERIX. As such ASTERIX does not maintain any indexes
     * on the data. The data for the dataset is fetched as and when required
     * from an external data source using an adapter. FEED : A dataset that can
     * be considered as a hybrid of INTERNAL and EXTERNAL dataset. A FEED
     * dataset is INTERNAL in the sense that the data is persisted within
     * ASTERIX storage and has associated indexes that are maintained by
     * ASTERIX. However the dataset is initially populated with data fetched
     * from an external datasource using an adapter, in a manner similar to an
     * EXTERNAL dataset. A FEED dataset continuously receives data from the
     * associated adapter.
